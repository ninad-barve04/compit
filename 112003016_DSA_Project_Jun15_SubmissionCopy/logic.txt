Arithmetic encoder

Arithmetic encoding is based on the probability of each symbol appearing in the 
source. 
Each symbol has a particulr frequency of appearing in the bytestream. Based on this
frequency, we can calculate the range corresponding to a single byte or multiple
bytes. This probability range can be decoded to give back original stream.
